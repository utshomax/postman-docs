## Managing your team profile

Your team profile gives you a way to share important information about your team with other Postman users. The profile brings together all your team's public resources in one place, and can serve as a developer portal for your API's consumers.

[Super Admins, Admins, and Community Managers](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can edit your team profile, customize your team's branding, and manage the public visibility of your team profile.

Your team profile includes:

* A short summary about your team and the work you do
* Social media links like your GitHub profile
* A list containing links to your team members' profiles
* A **Team Description** section
* A **Highlights** section with pinned elements
* A **Related collections and flows** section with collections and flows using your team's APIs (suggested by Postman)
* Links to all your team's public collections, APIs, workspaces, and flows

<img alt="Customize your team's branding" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/team-settings-customize-branding-v10.jpg" width="500px"/>

Keep the following in mind when you upload a logo, cover photo, or favicon:

* Logos and cover photos must be 500 KB or less in size and must be in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
* Logos must have a 1:1 aspect ratio (height:width), and cover photos must have a 1:7.5 aspect ratio. If your image has a different aspect ratio, Postman prompts you to select a part of your image to display.
* Favicons must be in ICO format, no larger than 32x32 pixels, and 500 KB or less in size. Your favicon appears on the browser tab of your team's published documentation site.

### Making your team profile public

A public team profile encourages other users to collaborate with you in a public workspace, enabling you to ask for contributions, gather feedback, and increase your API's discovery in search results.

If you enable your team's public profile, your team will be visible on [the Public API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore), along with your public workspaces, collections, APIs, and flows. Learn more about [the Public API Network and best practices for sharing elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/).

To make your [team profile](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) public, do the following:

1. In **Team Settings**, select **Team profile**.
1. Select **Make team profile public** to set the profile to public.
