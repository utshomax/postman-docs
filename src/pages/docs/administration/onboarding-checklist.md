To get started using Postman within your organization, you can walk through the following tasks to set your Postman team up for success. It's recommended that you first collaborate with your identified Team Admins and your organization's IT team to set up, secure, and manage Postman in your organization. Then you can set up your Postman team by configuring relevant settings, inviting people to your team and assigning them roles, and creating workspace resources related to your projects.

You can [download and install the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can also [access Postman on the web](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app) with the [Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/).

> If you're using the Postman web app, Postman recommends using the Postman Desktop Agent for the best experience. See [About the Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/) for more information.

## Set up Postman in your organization

To begin setting up Postman, assign the Team Admin role to one or more users. This role gives them permission to set up Postman and your team. Team Admins can then contact your IT team for help with setting up, managing, and securing Postman in your organization. After you set up Postman, you can [set up your Postman team](#set-up-your-postman-team).

### Manage Team Admins and support users

Identify users in your organization to be [Team Admins](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), giving them permission to manage team members and team settings. [Create a Postman account](/docs/getting-started/installation/postman-account/#signing-up-for-a-postman-account) for these users, and [assign them the Team Admin role](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-team-roles).

Team Admins can [assign the Super Admin role](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-super-admins) to team members and [groups](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/user-groups/), giving them permission to manage everything with a team. It's recommended that you create a user account that isn't tied to an individual team member, and assign the Super Admin role to that user account.

Team Admins can [assign the Admin and Billing roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to team members and groups. Team members who have only Admin or Billing roles (or both) become support users and don’t consume paid seats. Each team can have two support users.

### Contact your IT team

Contact your IT team to establish the procedure for adding a new piece of software, which varies from organization to organization. The following topics are common:

* Your IT team may need to add an exception to device policy allowing for Postman to be installed on employee workstations. Provide a [Postman download link​](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to the IT team to help establish this exception.

    > If you're on a [Postman Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing), your IT team can choose to deploy the Postman Enterprise app across your organization. For more information, see [Manage the Enterprise app](#manage-the-enterprise-app).

* If your organization's network connection is behind a proxy, you may need to configure Postman appropriately. Retrieve proxy connection details from your IT team and [​set them up within Postman](/docs/getting-started/installation/proxy/)​.

* If your organization operates behind a firewall, your IT team may need to [configure allowlists for Postman's domains](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-postman-behind-a-firewall). This ensures Postman data is synced with the cloud and all functionality works as expected.

* Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you may be able to obtain static IP addresses for Postman Monitors, enabling you to monitor APIs behind a restricted firewall. Your IT team must [allowlist static IPs for monitoring](/docs/monitoring-your-api/using-static-IPs-to-monitor/#allowlisting-static-ip-addresses).

### Secure your Postman team

Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you can secure your Postman team by setting up [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/), [SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/), and domain [verification](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/add-and-verify-a-domain/#why-should-my-organization-verify-a-domain-with-postman) and [capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/#why-should-my-organization-enable-domain-capture-in-postman). You must first configure SSO before you can configure SCIM provisioning and domain capture.

> You might need to contact your IT team for help with configuring SSO, SCIM, and domain verification and capture.

Team Admins can [configure domain verification](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/add-and-verify-a-domain/#add-and-verify-a-domain) to verify your organization's domain or subdomain. This enables you to instantly onboard users who created Postman accounts with your verified domain or subdomain. You must verify your domain or subdomain before you can configure domain capture. It's recommended that you begin the domain verification process early because the time to complete this task varies by organization.

Team Admins can [configure single sign-on (SSO) for your team](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/) to configure an authentication method for your team with an identity provider (IdP). Postman supports several IdPs you can use to configure SSO for your team. After you configure SSO for your team, it's recommended that you internally document how to [sign in to Postman with SSO](/docs/administration/sso/user-sso/), such as your Postman team's domain and steps for signing in with SSO details.

Team Admins can [configure SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) for your team](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#enabling-scim-provisioning) to automate user provisioning and de-provisioning for your Postman team using your IdP, such as Okta or OneLogin.

Team Admins can [configure domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/enable-domain-capture/) to consolidate Postman user accounts in your organization into a single team. Before you configure domain capture, it's recommended that you notify users that their accounts will be merged, and [enable Auto-flex](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) to ensure your team can automatically accommodate all users added to your team.

### Merge teams into a single account

You can merge one or more Postman teams into a single, company-authorized Postman account. This enables users in your organization to collaborate in the same Postman team. To merge Postman teams, you must [migrate team data into the company-authorized account](/docs/administration/team-merge/).

> Contact [Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support) to discuss the best team migration plan for your organization.

### Manage the Enterprise app

Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you may be able to manage Postman app versioning for your team, or download and install Postman's Enterprise app. Team Admins can [set a team-wide version of Postman](/docs/administration/enterprise/managing-enterprise-deployment/#managing-postman-app-versioning) with help from Postman support, or [download and install the Postman Enterprise app](/docs/administration/enterprise/managing-enterprise-deployment/#deploying-the-postman-enterprise-app) to their organization. Postman's Enterprise app is a variant of Postman’s Desktop app that offers greater control to administrators looking to deploy Postman at an enterprise level.

> You might need to contact your IT team for help with configuring the Enterprise app in your organization. This might include adding the Postman Enterprise app installer to your organization's internal app store for employees to install.
After you configure the Postman Enterprise app in your organization, it's recommended that you internally document how employees can install the app on their workstations.

## Set up your Postman team

After you [set up Postman](#set-up-postman), enable your teammates to find and join your team. You can also share invites with them directly. Once people are added to your team, you can begin assigning them roles based on the permissions each user needs in your team. Then you can begin collaborating with your teammates in workspaces, collections, and other workspaces resources.

### Configure team settings

Super Admins and Team Admins can [configure your team settings](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/) to ensure people in your organization can find and join your team. You can also keep your team profile updated for your API's consumers.

You can [make your team discoverable](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#making-your-team-discoverable) to enable people in your organization to find and join your team. When team discovery is enabled, Postman displays a list of teams to join when users in your organization access their Postman accounts. Anyone signing in with a company email address is presented with available teams and can make a request to join each one.

You can also [manage your team profile](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#managing-your-team-profile) to share information about your team with other Postman users. This ensures your API's consumers have important details about your team's public resources.

### Manage team members

Team Admins can [manage team members](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-team-members) by adding, removing, and assigning roles to users. You can also organize team members into groups, and assign roles to groups instead of individual users, enabling you to efficiently onboard new team members.

You can [invite users to your team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#inviting-users) by generating a shareable link or by inviting them through a direct email.

You can [assign team-level roles](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-team-roles) to individual team members, enabling them to perform different actions within your team. You can also [organize team members into groups](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/user-groups/), and assign team-level roles to groups.

> Learn more about [team-level roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles).

### Create workspaces and collections

[Organize your projects in workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/), including collections, APIs, and more. You can also use workspaces to collaborate with teammates, and [share APIs with your API's consumers](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/). If you're not sure how to set up your workspace based on your project's use case, you can [apply a template to a workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#apply-a-template-to-a-workspace) to help you get started. Once your workspace is set up, you can [add team members and groups to your workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#sharing-workspaces).

In your workspaces, you can [group your requests and examples into collections](/docs/collections/using-collections/). This enables you to keep your workspaces organized by project, collaborate with teammates, run tests on related requests, and more. If you're not sure how to set up your collection, you can [create a collection from a template](/docs/collections/using-collections/#using-collection-templates). Postman has a variety of collection templates you can use for your projects.

You can assign [workspace roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) to team members and groups at the [workspace level](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#managing-workspace-roles). You can also assign [element-based roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#element-based-roles) at the [element level](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/#managing-element-based-roles), such as collections and APIs.

Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you may also be able to [manage who can create team workspaces](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#manage-your-teams-workspaces) in your team.

### Configure integrations

Postman has multiple integrations for popular third-party solutions. You can [add integrations to your team](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/) to automatically share data between Postman and other tools, sync your collections and API definitions, and more.
