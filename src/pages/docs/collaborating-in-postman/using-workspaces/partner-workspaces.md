## Creating a Partner Workspace

1. Select **Workspaces** from the header, then select **Create Workspace**.

    <img alt="Workspace menu" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/workspace-switcher-v9.19.jpg" width="300px"/>

1. You can use [workspace templates](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-workspaces-with-a-template) to help you set up a new workspace. Select a workspace template to populate the workspace with helpful information and sample collections, or select **Blank workspace** to create an empty workspace. Then select **Next**.

    > You can also apply a workspace template to a newly created workspace. To learn more, see [Creating workspaces with a template](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-workspaces-with-a-template).

    <img alt="Create new workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/create-workspace-and-apply-template-full-screen-v10-2.jpg"/>

1. Define a workspace **Name** and **Summary**.
1. Under **Visibility**, select **Partner**.
1. Select **Create**.

    <img alt="Create Partner Workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/create-partner-workspace-v10-2.jpg" width="400px"/>

Anyone with permissions to create workspaces can request to create a Partner Workspace, but it must be approved by a [Partner Manager](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles). If you're not a [Super Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) or Partner Manager, you must submit your request for approval. You can also add an optional note to your request. The workspace's visibility will be set to [private](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#changing-workspace-visibility) until your request is approved. Postman will notify you when a Partner Manager reviews your request and approves or denies it.

To convert an existing workspace to a Partner Workspace, do the following:

1. Open the workspace. In the **Overview** tab, select **Workspace Settings** in the upper right.
1. Under **Visibility**, select **Partner**.
1. Select **Update**.

Anyone with permissions to change workspace visibility can request to convert a workspace into a Partner Workspace, but it must be approved by a [Partner Manager](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles). If you're not a [Super Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) or Partner Manager, Postman will mention this and you can add an optional note to your request. Postman will notify you when a Partner Manager reviews your request and approves or denies it.

> When a workspace is converted to a Partner Workspace, Postman sends in-app and email notifications to all workspace members.

## Setting up a Partner Workspace

Before sharing a Partner Workspace with external collaborators, you can set your partnership up for success by moving or forking relevant elements into it.

You can also use workspace templates to help set up a new partner workspace. For more information, see [Creating workspaces with a template](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-workspaces-with-a-template).

### Moving elements to a Partner Workspace

You must be an Editor on an API, collection, or environment, the Workspace Admin, Partner Manager, or a Super Admin to move an element to a Partner Workspace.

To move an element to a Partner Workspace, do the following:

1. In the sidebar, select the element you want to move. Then select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> > **Move**.

1. Use the search bar to find the workspace you'd like to move the element to, or filter by workspace visibility by selecting the filter icon <img alt="Filter icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-filter.jpg#icon" width="16px">.

    > You can move elements to Partner Workspaces that you have access to.

1. Select the workspace, then select **Move** (**Collection**, **API**, or **Environment**).

    <img alt="Move element Partner Workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/move-collection-to-partner-workspace-v10.jpg" width="400px"/>

Items related to what you're moving, such as monitors and mock servers, won't move with the element automatically. For more information, see [Moving elements to team workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaborating-in-team-workspaces/#moving-elements-to-team-workspaces).

If you'd like to keep certain elements in other workspaces, you can [fork them into Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-entities/#creating-a-fork) to help [keep them up to date](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-entities/#pulling-updates-from-a-parent-element) with any changes to the parent element.

## Inviting collaborators to a Partner Workspace

Workspace Admins, Partner Managers, and Partner Leads can invite partners to Partner Workspaces. Your team can invite three partners assigned the Workspace Editor role at no extra cost. When you assign a partner the Workspace Editor role, they can edit all workspace resources in the Partner Workspace, including collections. A paid seat is consumed when you assign partners the Workspace Editor or Collection Editor roles. Learn about [adding paid seats](#adding-partner-licenses).

> Learn more about [team and Partner Workspace roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

To invite partners to a Partner Workspace, do the following:

1. Open the workspace, select <img alt="Workspace settings icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-sliders-v10.jpg#icon" width="24px"> **Workspace Settings** in the workspace's **Overview** tab, and then select **Invite**.

    > You can also select **Invite** in the Postman header.

1. (Workspace Admins and Partner Managers only) Select **Partners**, then **Continue**.
1. Enter the name, email, or group name of the partners.
1. Set their [workspace role](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

    > Your team must have [available seats](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan) or [Auto-Flex enabled](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) to invite a partner as a Workspace Editor. Otherwise, the partner will be assigned the Workspace Viewer role, giving the partner permission to view all workspace resources. Assigning a partner the Workspace Viewer role doesn't consume paid seats.

1. (Workspace Admins and Partner Managers only) Select **Make them Partner Lead** if you'd like them to also be able to manage and invite partners within the workspace.
1. Select **Invite Partners**.

Partner invites must be accepted by the email address you provided when you invited the individual. If a partner would like to use a different email address, or if an invite was mistakenly sent, you can [revoke the invite](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-invites) and send a new one.

> Partners will sign in to your team with a Postman username and password, even if your team is restricted to signing in with [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/).

Workspace Admins and Partner Managers can invite team members to Partner Workspaces.

To invite team members to a Partner Workspace, do the following:

1. Open the workspace, select <img alt="Workspace settings icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-sliders-v10.jpg#icon" width="24px"> **Workspace Settings** in the workspace's **Overview** tab, and then select **Invite**.

    > You can also select **Invite** in the Postman header.

1. Select **Team members**, then **Continue**.
1. Enter the name, email, or group name of the team members.
1. Set their [workspace role](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles).
1. Select **Send Invites**.

## Viewing resources a partner can access

A [Partner Manager](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles) can view the Partner Workspaces and collections a partner can access. A Partner Manager can also view the Workspace role partners are assigned in each workspace, and the Collection role partners are assigned in each collection. Open your [team dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/members) and select **View resources** next to a partner. Select a Partner Workspace or collection name to open it in a new tab.

## Collaborating in a Partner Workspace

The collaborative experience that Partner Workspaces offer depends on your role and status as a team member or external partner.

### Collaborating as a team member

Partner Workspaces are only visible to invited team members, similar to [private workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/). Once invited, you can access Partner Workspaces as you would access any other workspace. To open one, select **Workspaces** in the Postman header, then select the Partner Workspace.

Users can be assigned the team-level Partner Manager role. Partner Managers can view all Partner Workspaces within an organization, and can control their settings, visibility, and partner invites. To learn more, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

### Collaborating as a partner

When an external partner is [invited to a Partner Workspace](#inviting-collaborators-to-a-partner-workspace) by a team they're working with, they only have access to that Partner Workspace and can't access any other workspaces or resources within the team. Partners don't have personal or team workspaces within the team they're partnering with.

At the team level, all external partners are automatically assigned the Partner role. At the workspace level, all partners are assigned the [Workspace Editor or Viewer](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles) roles. If partners are assigned the Workspace Editor role, they can edit all workspace resources in the Partner Workspace, including collections. If partners are assigned the Workspace Viewer role, they can be assigned the Collection Editor role for specific collections. Partners can also be assigned the Partner Lead role, which enables them to invite other individuals from their organization to the Partner Workspace.

> To learn more about partner roles and permissions, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

## Managing a Partner Workspace

Workspace Admins and Partner Managers manage workspace settings, users, and roles within a Partner Workspace. Partner Leads also manage users and roles of partners in Partner Workspaces.

### Managing users and roles

You can assign team and Partner Workspace roles based on the functions team members and partners require. You can assign team roles for Partner Workspace roles at the [team level](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/), and you can assign Partner Workspace roles at the [workspace level](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#managing-workspace-roles) and collection level. Learn more about [team and Partner Workspace roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

To learn more about collaborating as a team member or partner, see [Collaborating in a Partner Workspace](#collaborating-in-a-partner-workspace).

### Adding partner licenses

Your team has three partner licenses you can use to assign partners the [Workspace Editor or Collection Editor roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles). A paid seat is consumed when a partner is assigned at least one Editor role (at the workspace or collection level) in at least one Partner Workspace. Assigning a partner the Workspace Viewer or Collection Viewer role doesn't consume paid seats.

To assign more than three Workspace Editor or Collection Editor roles to partners, you must purchase additional partner licenses. To purchase more partner licenses, contact your Postman Account Manager or [contact Postman's sales team](mailto:sales@postman.com).

> Your team must have [available seats](/docs/administration/billing/#changing-your-plan) or [Auto-Flex enabled](/docs/administration/billing/#using-auto-flex) to [invite a partner](#inviting-collaborators-to-a-partner-workspace) as a Workspace Editor. Otherwise, the partner will be assigned the Workspace Viewer role, giving the partner permission to view all workspace resources. Also, your team must have available seats to assign a partner as a Collection Editor.

### Managing workspace elements

To move elements to a Partner Workspace, see [Moving elements to a Partner Workspace](#moving-elements-to-a-partner-workspace).

To remove elements from a Partner Workspace, see [Removing elements from a Partner Workspace](#removing-elements-from-a-partner-workspace).

### Editing workspace details

Workspace Admins and Partner Managers can edit Partner Workspace details. On the workspace's Overview tab, select the workspace name, summary, or description to edit it. You can add Markdown to the description—select **Save** when you're done.

## Removing elements from a Partner Workspace

You must be at least an Editor on an API, collection, or environment to remove an element from a Partner Workspace. You can also be a Workspace Admin, Partner Manager, or Super Admin to remove any element from a Partner Workspace.

To remove an element by moving it to another workspace, do the following:

1. In the sidebar, select the element you want to move, then select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> > **Move**.

1. Use the search bar to find the workspace you'd like to move the element to, or filter by workspace visibility by selecting the filter icon <img alt="Filter icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-filter.jpg#icon" width="16px">.

    > You can only move elements to workspaces that you have access to.

1. Select the workspace, then **Move** (**Collection**, **API**, or **Environment**).

It's not recommended, but you can choose to delete an element entirely. To do so, select the element in the sidebar, then select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> > **Delete**.

> Deleted APIs and environments aren't recoverable. You can recover collections smaller than 30 MB for up to 90 days on an Enterprise plan. To do so, select <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-delete-v9.jpg#icon" width="12px"> **Trash** from the Postman footer.

## Removing partners from a Partner Workspace

You can remove partners from individual Partner Workspaces. To remove a partner from a Partner Workspace, see [Managing workspace roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#managing-workspace-roles).

You can remove partners from a team. Removing a partner from a team removes them from all Partner Workspaces. If you remove the last Admin from the team, users assigned the Partner Manager role will be assigned the Admin role. Also, if you remove a partner from their last Partner Workspace, they'll be removed from the team. To remove a partner from a team, see [Removing team members](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#removing-team-members).

## Deleting a Partner Workspace

Workspace Admins and Partner Managers can delete Partner Workspaces.

1. On the workspace's **Overview** tab, select **Workspace Settings**.
1. [Change the visibility of the workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#changing-workspace-visibility) to **Private**.
1. Select **Remove all partners**, then select **Update**.
1. Select **Delete Workspace**.

> Postman notifies all workspace members in-app and by email when you delete a Partner Workspace.
