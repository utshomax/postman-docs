## Adding elements

API Network Managers can add elements to the Private API Network. Folder Managers can add elements to folders they have permission to manage. Workspace Editors, Collection Editors, and API Editors must [request to add elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/private-network-requests/#requesting-to-add-elements) to the Private API Network.

To add an element to the Private API Network, it must be in a team or public workspace. You can't add an element to the Private API Network unless all team members have at least view access to the element. Learn more about team [roles and permissions](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/).

The collections and APIs you add to the Private API Network include the latest changes to these elements.

> When you add a workspace, collection, or API to the [Private API Network](https://go.postman.co/network/private), it's visible to your Postman team, but isn't visible to [partners](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/).

<!-- -->

1. Select **Add API**.

#### Publishing specific API versions

Publishing a version creates a static representation of your API that consumers can view on the Private API Network. If your API is connected to a Git repository, you need to publish an API version to update your team or public workspace with the latest changes. When you publish a version, the API's definition and collections are synced to the Postman cloud.

Learn more about [publishing an API version](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/api-versions/).

#### Importing APIs from a code repository

You can make all your existing APIs discoverable on the Private API Network after you import them from a code repository. Learn more about [importing an API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/).

## Reviewing requests to add elements

API Network Managers can review requests to add elements to the Private API Network. Folder Managers can review requests to add elements to folders they have permission to manage.

When an Editor requests to add an element to your team's Private API Network, Postman will send you an email and an in-app notification. For the list of all the pending requests, open the [Private API Network](https://go.postman.co/network/private) and select the pending requests icon <img alt="Pending requests icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-pending-request-v10.jpg#icon" width="22px"> in the left sidebar.
