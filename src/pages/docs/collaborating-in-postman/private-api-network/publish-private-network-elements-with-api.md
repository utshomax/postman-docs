> **[The Private API Network is available on Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**

You can use the Postman API to programmatically manage your Private API Network’s resources. With it, you can easily automate the publication of your team's Private API Network.

* [Add elements to your Private API Network folder](#add-elements-to-your-private-api-network-folder)

    * [Add a workspace to a folder](#add-a-workspace-to-a-folder)

## Getting started

You can get started by [forking the Postman API collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/collection/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a/fork?origin=sidebar) in the Postman Public Workspace. This collection contains all the available [Private API Network endpoints](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/documentation/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a?entity=folder-b7c02959-88ca-4e2f-9b68-99538eed4533&branch=&version=).

You will also need an API key to use the Postman API. For information, see [Generate a Postman API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key).

> Access rate limits for your Postman API key depend on your Postman plan. For more information, see [Postman API rate limits](/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-api-rate-limits/).

## Create a Private API Network folder

This HTTP request [creates a folder](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/example/12959542-22a2c7a4-aa34-4501-9eca-d22ea620f07f) in your Private API Network. A folder can contain multiple elements, such as [workspaces](#add-a-workspace-to-a-folder), [collections](#add-a-collection-to-a-folder), or [APIs](#add-an-api-to-a-folder).

In your request, we recommend using an environment variable (like `{{postman-api-key}}`) so you can easily reuse your API key. By default, this API creates the folder in the root Home folder of the Private API Network:

```http
POST /network/private HTTP/1.1
Host: api.getpostman.com
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-Key: {{postman-api-key}}
Content-Length: 94

{
    "folder": {
        "name": "Billing",
        "description": "The Billing API."
    }
}
```

The same HTTP request in Postman:

![The API call in Postman](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/create-private-network-folder-api.jpg)

On success, your request’s response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "parentFolderId": 0,
    "updatedAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "updatedBy": 12345678,
    "createdBy": 12345678,
    "createdAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "name": "Billing",
    "description": "The Billing API.",
    "type": "folder"
}
```

You can also find your new folder in the Private API Network's root Home directory:

<img alt="New folder in Private Network" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/private-api-network-organize-folders-v10-3.jpg" width="400px"/>

Save the `id` value in the response. For example, save it as a collection variable called `{{folderId}}`. You can then use it as the `parentFolderId` value in other requests, such as adding elements to the folder or subfolders.

## Add elements to your Private API Network folder

Your Private API Network folder's elements (collections, APIs, and workspaces) are links to the original element. If that source element changes, then the Private API Network automatically reflects these changes.

In the following examples, the `{{folderId}}` variable references the `id` value returned when you created the Private API Network folder (for example, `1`).

### Add a collection to a folder

This HTTP request [adds a collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/example/12959542-c3766325-01d8-4f71-963f-a95892451acc) to your Private API Network folder.

```http
POST /network/private HTTP/1.1
Host: api.getpostman.com
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: {{postman-api-key}}
Content-Length: 131

{
    "collection": {
        "id": "12345678-12ece9e1-2abf-4edc-8e34-de66e74114d2",
        "parentFolderId": {{folderId}}
    }
}
```

The response to this request will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "addedAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "addedBy": 12345678,
    "createdBy": 12345678,
    "createdAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "updatedBy": 12345678,
    "updatedAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "type": "collection",
    "id": "12345678-12ece9e1-2abf-4edc-8e34-de66e74114d2",
    "name": "Billing API Collection",
    "summary": null,
    "description": "The Billing API collection.",
    "href": "https://api.getpostman.com/collections/12345678-12ece9e1-2abf-4edc-8e34-de66e74114d2",
    "parentFolderId": 1
}
```

### Add an API to a folder

Before you add an API to your Private API Network folder, first make sure it's published. Private API Network APIs must have a published version associated with it.

Then, use the following HTTP request to [add an API](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/example/12959542-66c2f1f2-0532-4c65-8508-2392935b82ce) to the Private API Network folder:

```http
POST /network/private HTTP/1.1
Host: api.getpostman-beta.com
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: {{postman-api-key}}
Content-Length: 115

{
    "api": {
        "id": "5360b75f-447e-467c-9299-12fd6c92450d",
        "parentFolderId": {{folderId}}
    }
}
```

The response to this request will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "addedAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "addedBy": 12345678,
    "createdBy": 12345678,
    "createdAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "updatedBy": 12345678,
    "updatedAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "type": "api",
    "id": "5360b75f-447e-467c-9299-12fd6c92450d",
    "name": "Billing API",
    "summary": "The payments and account services API.",
    "description": null,
    "href": "https://api.getpostman.com/apis/5360b75f-447e-467c-9299-12fd6c92450d",
    "parentFolderId": 1
}
```

### Add a workspace to a folder

This HTTP request [adds a workspace](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/example/12959542-afbc11ef-ecc1-4245-ad3f-988fccd47936) to your Private API Network folder:

```http
POST /network/private HTTP/1.1
Host: api.getpostman.com
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: {{postman-api-key}}
Content-Length: 121

{
    "workspace": {
        "id": "1f0df51a-8658-4ee8-a2a1-d2567dfa09a9",
        "parentFolderId": {{folderId}}
    }
}
```

The response to this request will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "addedAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "addedBy": 12345678,
    "createdBy": 12345678,
    "createdAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "updatedBy": 12345678,
    "updatedAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "type": "workspace",
    "id": "1f0df51a-8658-4ee8-a2a1-d2567dfa09a9",
