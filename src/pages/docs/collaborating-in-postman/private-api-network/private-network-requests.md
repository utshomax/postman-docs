## Requesting to add elements

To request to add an element to the Private API Network, it must be in a team or public workspace. You can't request to add an element to the Private API Network unless all team members have at least view access to the element. Learn more about team [roles and permissions](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/).

When you submit a request, Postman notifies the [API Network Manager or Folder Manager](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#network-roles) who will review your request and either approve or deny it. Postman will notify you of the API Network Manager or Folder Manager's decision. If they deny your request, the notification will include a comment with their reason.

> When you add a workspace, collection, or API to the [Private API Network](https://go.postman.co/network/private), it's visible to your Postman team, but isn't visible to [partners](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/).

### Requesting to add elements in your Private API Network

Editors of an element can request to add elements from inside your team's Private API Network.

To request to add elements from your Private API network, do the following:

1. Open your [Private API Network](https://go.postman.co/network/private).
1. Select the **+** icon in the left sidebar to request to add elements to the root Home folder. To request to add elements to a specific folder, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the folder, then select **Request to add elements**.

    > You can also select **Add** on the right from the Private API Network overview page, or select **Add To Folder** in the upper-right corner.

1. Search for and then select collections, APIs, and workspaces you want to request to add. You can also filter elements by tags. Learn more about adding tags to [collections](/docs/collections/using-collections/#tagging-a-collection), [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/managing-apis/#tagging-apis), and [workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#tagging-a-workspace).

    If you're requesting to add collections, you can optionally select environments in their workspace to make sure users have access to environment variables. You can also [edit a collection's environments later](#editing-collections).

    You can select **Added elements** in the upper-right corner to show elements already added to the Private API Network. You can select the **Collections** tab and then **Forks** in the upper-right corner to show [forked collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-entities/).

    > An API's editor must [publish a version of the API](#publishing-specific-api-versions) before you can add it to your Private API Network.

    <!-- -->

    > You can select an element's name to open it in its workspace in a new tab.

1. Select **Review**.

## Reviewing requests to add elements

API Network Managers can review requests to add elements to the Private API Network. Folder Managers can review requests to add elements to folders they have permission to manage.

When an Editor requests to add an element to your team's Private API Network, Postman will send you an email and an in-app notification. For the list of all the pending requests, open the [Private API Network](https://go.postman.co/network/private) and select the pending requests icon <img alt="Pending requests icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-pending-request-v10.jpg#icon" width="22px"> in the left sidebar.

Pending requests include the element type, the user who submitted the request, the date they submitted it on, a link to view the element in its workspace, and an optional note from the requesting user.

<img alt="Approve or deny a request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/private-api-network-pending-requests-v10-2.jpg"/>
