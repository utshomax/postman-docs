> Certain team options are only available on **[Postman paid plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**. To learn which roles are available on your plan, go to your **[web dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/roles)**.

Roles define user permissions within a Postman team and a user's level of access to a Postman element, like a collection or an API.

## Team roles

With the [Admin role](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), you have the power to define Postman access at the team level. You can use Postman's role-based access control system to limit visibility of team resources, define your development workflow, and give access to administrative and billing personnel. Each user on a team must have at least one role attached to them, and can hold multiple roles simultaneously.

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/) one or more role types to team members, based on the functions those team members require:

* **Super Admin** ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)) - Manages everything within a team, including team settings, members, roles, and resources. This role can view and manage all elements in [public, team, private, and personal workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#changing-workspace-visibility). Super Admins can perform all actions that other roles can perform. For information on assigning this role, see [Managing Super Admins](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-super-admins).
* **Admin** - Manages team members and team settings. Can also view monitor metadata and run, pause, and resume monitors.
* **Billing** - Manages team plan and payments. Billing roles can be granted by a Super Admin, Team Admin, or by a fellow team member with a Billing role.
* **Developer** - Has access to all team resources and workspaces.
* **Community Manager** ([Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)) - Manages the public visibility of workspaces and team profile.
* **Partner Manager** (Internal, [Enterprise Ultimate plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)) - Manages all [Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/) within an organization. Controls Partner Workspace settings and visibility, and can send invites to partners. To learn more, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).
* **Partner** (External, [Enterprise Ultimate plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)) - All partners are automatically granted the Partner role at the team level. Partners can only access the [Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/) they've been invited to. To learn more, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).
* **Guest** (External) - Views collections and sends requests in collections that have been shared with them. This role can't be directly assigned to a user. To learn more, see [Allowing external users to view collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#allowing-external-users-to-view-collections).
* **Flow Editor** ([Basic and Professional plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/#postman-flows-access-and-pricing)) - Can create, edit, run, and publish [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/gs/flows-overview/).

> If you are on a [Postman Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you can also assign roles at the [group level](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/user-groups/).

&ast; On Postman Basic and Free plans, any developer can change visibility of workspaces.

&ast;&ast; Enterprise and Professional plans only.

&ast;&ast;&ast; Enterprise plans only. Teams can allow users with the [Folder Manager role](#network-roles) to manage elements in specific folders in the Private API Network.

### Managing team roles

To learn how to manage team roles in Postman, see [Managing your team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/).

## Workspace roles

You can [assign](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#managing-workspace-roles) three role types in Postman workspaces: **Admin**, **Editor**, and **Viewer**. Partner Workspaces offer an additional role type: **Partner Lead**.

* **Admin** - Can manage workspace resources and settings.
* **Editor** ([Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)) - Can create and edit workspace resources.
* **Viewer** ([Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)) - Can view, fork, and export workspace resources.
* **Partner Lead** (External, [Enterprise Ultimate plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)) - Can invite other partners from their organization to join a [Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/). To learn more, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

Partners have different permissions for Workspace Editor and Viewer roles in Partner Workspaces ([Enterprise Ultimate plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)). To learn more, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

The following roles control access at a workspace level:

| Action | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Join and leave workspaces | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | &#x2714; |
| Send requests | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | &#x2714; |
| Add and remove APIs, collections, and environments | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | |
| Manage integrations | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | |
| Add monitors and mock servers | &#x2714; | &#x2714; | |
| Create and delete workspaces | &#x2714; | | |
| Edit workspace details | &#x2714; | | |
| Add and remove members | &#x2714; | | |
| Manage workspace roles | &#x2714; | | |
| Manage workspace visibility | &#x2714;&ast; | | |

&ast; On Professional and Enterprise plans, an Admin for a workspace must request to change its visibility to public. This request will go to the [Community Manager](#team-roles). On Basic and Free plans, or if a team has no Community Manager assigned, an Admin for a workspace can control its visibility.

## Element-based roles

At the element level, you can assign roles to team members that decide their level of access to Postman [collections](#collection-roles), [APIs](#api-roles), [mock servers](#mock-server-roles), and [monitors](#monitor-roles).

### Collection roles

You can [assign](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/#managing-element-based-roles) two role types in Postman collections: **Editor** and **Viewer**.

* **Editor** - Can edit collections directly

Partners have different permissions for Collection Editor and Viewer roles in Partner Workspaces ([Enterprise Ultimate plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)). To learn more, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

You can assign a limited Viewer role to an external user who isn't in your Postman team by [allowing them to view specific collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#allowing-external-users-to-view-collections). Users with this role can only view collections and send requests in the collections that have been shared with them.

The following roles control access at a collection level:

## Partner team and Partner Workspace roles

> **[Partner team and Partner Workspace roles are available on Postman Enterprise Ultimate plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**

Partner team and Partner Workspace roles relate to [Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/) and are applied at the team, workspace, and collection levels. There are different team and Partner Workspace roles you can assign to team members and external partners:

|  | For team members | For partners |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| **Team level** | Partner Manager | Partner |
| **Workspace level** | Admin, Viewer, Editor | Viewer, Editor <br> Partner Lead (optional) |
| **Collection level** | Viewer, Editor | Viewer, Editor |

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/) the Partner Manager role to team members at the team level, and [invite](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/#inviting-collaborators-to-a-partner-workspace) partners with the Partner role:

* **Partner Manager** - Manages all Partner Workspaces within an organization. Controls Partner Workspace settings and visibility, and can send invites to partners.
* **Partner** - All partners are automatically granted the Partner role at the team level. Partners can only access the Partner Workspaces they've been invited to. All partners are assigned [Workspace Editor or Viewer](#workspace-roles) roles when invited to a Partner Workspace. You can edit Partner Workspace permissions for partners at the workspace and collection levels.

You can [assign](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#managing-workspace-roles) Partner Workspace roles to partners at the workspace level:

* **Partner Lead**  - Can invite other partners from their organization to join a Partner Workspace.
* **Editor** - Partners can create and edit Partner Workspace resources, [import and export](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-and-exporting-overview/) elements, and [fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) elements to Partner Workspaces within the same team.
* **Viewer** - Partners can view Partner Workspace resources and [fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) elements to another Partner Workspace within the same team where they're assigned the Workspace Editor role.

You can also [assign](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/#managing-element-based-roles) Partner Workspace roles to partners at the collection level:

* **Editor** - Partners can [export collections](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#exporting-collections). They can also [fork collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) within the same Partner Workspace or to another Partner Workspace within the same team. They can't fork collections outside the team.
* **Viewer** - Partners can [fork collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) to another Partner Workspace within the same team where they're assigned the Workspace Editor role. They can't fork elements outside the team. Also, they can't export collections.

To learn more about collaborating as a team member or partner, see [Collaborating in a Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/#collaborating-in-a-partner-workspace).

> Your team must have [available seats](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan) or [Auto-Flex enabled](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) to invite a partner as a Workspace Editor. Otherwise, the partner will be assigned the Workspace Viewer role, giving the partner permission to view all workspace resources. Also, your team must have available seats to assign a partner as a Collection Editor. Assigning a partner the Workspace Viewer or Collection Viewer roles doesn't consume paid seats.

## Network roles

> **[Network roles are available on Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**

Network roles related to the [Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/adding-private-network/) are applied at the team and folder level.

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/) network roles at the team level:

* **API Network Manager** - Manages a team's Private API Network, including adding elements and reviewing requests to add them.

You can also [assign](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/organizing-private-network/#editing-folder-managers) network roles at the folder level:

* **Folder Manager** - Manages specific folders and the elements in them in a team's Private API Network. Team members with this role can perform all actions that API Network Manager role can perform but only in folders they have permission to manage.

## Next steps

After learning about the roles available to team members, you can manage your team's level of access and control more effectively.
