_Postman Live Collections_ enable you to keep your collections up-to-date based on the usage of your application. By observing your application, the Postman SDK automatically updates your Live Collections.

Live Collections provide the following benefits:

* **Improved collaboration** - A Postman Live Collection can be shared among developers, testers, and other stakeholders. This enables everyone to stay up-to-date on the latest changes and improvements to the API.
* **Better testing** - With a Postman Live Collection, developers and testers can easily test the API in a real environment. This can help identify issues and bugs before they are deployed to production.
* **Faster development** - A Postman Live Collection can streamline the development process by enabling developers to quickly and easily set up their collection and maintain it. This can help automate the manual process of creating and updating collections which sometimes results in an incomplete collection.
* **Better documentation** -  A Postman Live Collection can be used to generate documentation for the API. This documentation can be updated in real-time, making it easier for developers to understand and use the API.

Developers can enable Postman Live Collections by installing the Postman SDK in their application. Once enabled, you can use Live Collections to:

* Automatically keep collections up-to-date
* Bring insights such as error codes and examples from usage patterns for developers to build quality, efficient, and secure APIs
