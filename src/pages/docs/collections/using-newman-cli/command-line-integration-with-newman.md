Newman is a command-line Collection Runner for Postman. It enables you to run and test a Postman Collection directly from the command line. It's built with extensibility in mind so that you can integrate it with your continuous integration (CI) servers and build systems.

Newman maintains feature parity with Postman and allows you to run collections the way they're executed inside the collection runner in Postman.

Newman resides in the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman).

You can also run collections from the command line using the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/). For more information on the differences between Newman and the Postman CLI, see [deciding which command-line companion to use](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/#deciding-which-command-line-companion-to-use).

## Getting started

To get started, install Node.js and Newman, then run your collections. Learn more about [installing and running Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/installing-running-newman/).

## Options

Newman provides a rich set of options to customize a run. Learn more about [Newman options](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-options/).

## File uploads

Newman supports file uploads, so you can use a data file (such as a text file) to fill in form data fields. Learn more about [uploading files in Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-file-uploads/).

## Custom reporters

Custom reporters are useful to generate collection run reports that cater to specific use cases, for example, logging out the response body when a request (or its tests) fail. Learn more about [using Newman custom reporters](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-custom-reporters/).
