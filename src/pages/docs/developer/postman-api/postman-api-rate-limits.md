Postman's API access rate limits are applied at a per-key basis in unit time.

Access to the API using a key is limited to **300 requests per minute**. Every API response includes the following set of headers to identify the status of your consumption:

| Header                 | Description   |
| ---                    | ---           |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`    | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per minute. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining`| The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`    | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in, UTC epoch seconds. |

## Free API calls with your Postman account

Your Postman account gives you a limited number of free Postman API calls per month. You can check your usage limits with the [Postman API](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/documentation/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a) or the [resource usage page](https://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview).

To learn more about the resources included with your Postman plan and what happens when you reach your usage limits, go to [About resource usage](/docs/administration/resource-usage/).
