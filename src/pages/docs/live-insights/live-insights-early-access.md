The Live Insights team at Postman is working toward the open launch of Live Insights. Today, the alpha launch focuses on the Live Collections Agent (LCA), which passively watches your API traffic to automatically populate a Postman Collection with API endpoints. Within 15 minutes of installing the Live Collections Agent in staging or production, you’ll start to see endpoints in your collection. The Live Collections Agent will keep these endpoints up to date based on new observed traffic.

API discovery is just the beginning of what Postman plans to offer. Akita users are familiar with the ability to explore API models based on error, latency, and volume.

The Live Insights team is hoping you will try out the new features and send your feedback to help Postman continue tailoring the product to your needs.

## Feedback

If you’ve agreed to participate in the alpha, Postman kindly asks you to:

* Install the Live Collections Agent within two weeks of receiving these instructions. We would love installation feedback as you go, in Slack or by email.
* Fill out a survey or do a live user interview within one month of receiving access.
* Optionally, provide feedback on product designs and upcoming features.

The Live Insights team would love to talk to you in Slack to get questions, bug reports, and feature requests as you explore the alpha. If you’d like to provide detailed product feedback, please send it to [Live Insights Alpha team](live.insights.alpha@postman.com).
