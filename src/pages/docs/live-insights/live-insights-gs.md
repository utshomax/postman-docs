To get started using Live Insights, ensure you have a team workspace set up in Postman. If you don’t already have a team in Postman, see [Collaboration overview](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaboration-overview/#creating-a-team) for instructions on how to set it up. The Postman Free plan provides team setup with up to three users. Once your team workspace is set up, contact [Live Insights Alpha team](mailto:live.insights.alpha@postman.com) to get access to the Live Insights alpha in Postman.

Next, create a collection and install the LCA locally. Then, configure the LCA for your deployment. Finally, return to Postman to [check your LCA connection](#check-your-lca-connection), [navigate your collection](#navigate-live-collections), and [observe live insights](#observe-live-insights) about your endpoints. You can also [review any traffic errors](/docs/live-insights/live-insights-troubleshoot/).

## Contents

## Create a collection

1. In Postman, create and name a collection. For more information about how to create and manage collections, see [Collections overview](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/collections-overview/).

1. In the collection **Overview**, select **Get Started** to enable a live collection.

    ![Enable live collection](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-test-collection-v10-19.jpg)

1. In the **Enabling Live** tab, select **Using the Live Collection Agent.**

## Install the Live Collections Agent locally

In your shell, run:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L https://releases.observability.postman.com/scripts/install-postman-lc-agent.sh)"
```

## Configure the LCA in your deployment

Currently, you can install and run the Live Collections Agent (LCA) on [Kubernetes](#kubernetes-deployment), [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](#ecs-ec2-and-fargate-deployment), and [Amazon EC2/Linux Server](#amazon-ec2linux-server-deployment).

### Kubernetes deployment

To get started using Live Insights, ensure you have a team workspace set up in Postman. If you don’t already have a team in Postman, see [Collaboration overview](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaboration-overview/#creating-a-team) for instructions on how to set it up. Postman Free provides team setup with up to three users. Once your team workspace is set up, contact [Live Insights Alpha team](mailto:live.insights.alpha@postman.com) to get access to the Live Insights alpha in Postman.

Next, [create a collection](#create-a-collection) and [install the LCA locally](#install-the-live-collections-agent-locally). Then, configure the LCA using the Kubernetes injector (`kube inject`).

The injector is a tool that operates on the YAML definition of a Kubernetes deployment in an offline fashion, similar to [Istio’s manual sidecar injection](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/#manual-sidecar-injection).

#### Configure

Set up the LCA in your Kubernetes environment using `kube inject`, and edit the deployment using additional command flags. For more information about this command and its flags, see [Live Collection Agent reference](/docs/live-insights/reference).

1. Navigate to the correct Kubernetes cluster and get the existing deployment configuration.

    ```bash
    kubectl get deployment -n <your_namespace> <your_deployment> -o yaml > <your_deployment_file>.yaml
    ```

1. Get the collection ID and your API key. Then, run the configuration script.

    Select your Postman Collection and then **Info** in the right sidebar. Then, copy the collection ID.

    ![Get the collection ID](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-collectionID-v10-19.jpg)

    You can find the Postman API key in your [API keys](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys) page.

    The script consists of your Postman API key, the `postman-lc-agent kube inject` command, and the collection ID.

    In your shell, add your API key and the collection ID to the script, replace the placeholder `<your_deployment_file>` with the path to your deployment's YAML configuration file, then run the script. This alters the deployment to include the LCA.

    ```bash
    POSTMAN_API_Key=<your_api_key> postman-lc-agent kube inject --collection <collectionID> -f <your_deployment_file>.yaml -s | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

    The command creates a secret to hold your Postman key and updates the deployment with the Postman sidecar. The response looks something like this:

    ```shell
    secret/postman-agent-secrets created
    deployment.apps/cloud-api-deployment configured
    ```

1. Check the status of your Kubernetes container pods.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n <your_namespace>
    ```

    The status response looks something like this:

    ```shell
    NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
    cloud-api-deployment-5db4fBc64-cknhc 2/2 Running 0 4h40m
    cloud-api-deployment-7f97856c7f-p5Lv7 2/2 Running 0 15h
    ```

1. Get the logs from the sidecar.

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n <your_namespace> <your_pod> postman-lc-agent
    ```

    Let the LCA run for 60 seconds and observe the HTTP and TLS traffic on your ports.

1. Return to Postman and select **View Collection**. Observe subdirectories created for services and health checks.

    > Subdirectories can take a few minutes to populate.

    Observe the Live Collections icon <img alt="Live Collections icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-live-collections.jpg#icon" width="16px"> denoting a live collection and the counter badge indicating the number of requests.

    ![Live collection enabled](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-live-enabled-v10-19.jpg)

You are ready to [check your LCA connection](#check-your-lca-connection), [navigate your collection](#navigate-live-collections), and [observe live insights](#observe-live-insights) about your endpoints. You can also [review any traffic errors](/docs/live-insights/live-insights-troubleshoot/).

#### Uninstall

To uninstall the LCA client on Debian and macOS follow the steps listed below. For all other distributions of Linux and other operating systems, simply remove the `postman-lc-agent` file from your executable file location. To fully uninstall, also remove the sidecar from your Kubernetes deployment.

Follow these steps to uninstall the LCA client from Debian and macOS.

* Debian

    ```bash
    apt remove postman-lc-agent
    ```

* macOS

    ```bash
    brew uninstall postman-lc-agent
    ```

To remove the sidecar from your Kubernetes deployment:

1. Access the sidecar in your Kubernetes deployment directory.

    ```bash
    kubectl edit -n {your namespace} deployment/{your namespace}
    ```

1. Find the `"spec:" / "containers:"` section.
1. Delete the Live Collections Agent container with `"image: docker.postman.com/postman-lc-agent:latest"`.

### ECS (EC2 and Fargate) deployment

The Live Collections Agent (LCA) supports Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) on EC2 and ECS Fargate deployments.

The LCA listens to the traffic arriving at the cluster service you want to monitor and creates a Postman Collection for it.

To get started using Live Insights, ensure you have a team worskpace set up in Postman. If you don’t already have a team in Postman, see [Collaboration overview](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaboration-overview/#creating-a-team) for instructions on how to set it up. Postman Free provides team setup with up to three users. Once your team workspace is set up, contact [Live Insights Alpha team](mailto:live.insights.alpha@postman.com) to get access to the Live Insights alpha in Postman.

Next, [create a collection](#create-a-collection) and [install the LCA locally](#install-the-live-collections-agent-locally). Then, follow the instructions for your deployment below.

#### Installation options

* If you’re using Fargate, you can [install LCA as a sidecar](#install-lca-as-a-sidecar) only.
* If you’re using ECS on EC2 with awsvpc, you can install it as a [sidecar](#install-lca-as-a-sidecar) or as a [daemon service](#install-lca-as-a-daemon-service).
* If you’re using ECS on EC2 with bridge networking, you can [install LCA as a daemon service](#install-lca-as-a-daemon-service) only.

#### Requirements

Configuring ECS requires:

* Internet access for your service, to be able to communicate with the Live Insights backend services. For more information, see [Ensure internet access](#ensure-internet-access).
* AWS credentials at `~/.aws/credentials` with edit access to ECS cluster, service and task definition. For more information, see [Set up AWS ECS permissions](#set-up-aws-ecs-permissions).
* Cluster ARN. Navigate to the cluster in the AWS console and find the ARN in the cluster overview.
* Service ARN. The ARN of the service on which you want to install the Live Collections Agent.
* Collection ID. You can find the collection ID by selecting your Postman Collection and then **Info** in the right sidebar.

    ![Get the collection ID](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-collectionID-v10-19.jpg)

* Postman API key. You can copy it from your [API keys](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys) page.

#### Install LCA as a sidecar

Following are instructions for installing the LCA as a sidecar container. If you are using ECS on EC2 with bridge networking, you will need to attach the LCA to the host network. See [Install LCA as a daemon service](#install-lca-as-a-daemon-service).

1. Check [Requirements](#requirements) to see the information you need to have. Then, run the following script, substituting your values.

    ```bash
    POSTMAN_API_KEY=<your_api_key> postman-lc-agent ecs add \
    --collection <collectionID> \
    --cluster <ECS_cluster_ARN> \
    --profile <aws_profile_name> \
    --region <aws_region> \
    --service <ECS_service_ARN> \
    --task <task-name>
    ```

    ![ECS sidecar configuration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-ecs-shell-v10-19.jpg)

    See the help menu for further configuration.

    ```bash
    postman-lc-agent ecs --help
    ```

    > The time it takes for the deployment to complete depends on the number of tasks running in a service. Therefore, while the process might take a while, the CLI will run until it’s finished because the processing is handled by AWS.

1. Return to Postman and observe subdirectories created for services. You may see additional subdirectories created from health checks of your application's endpoints/traffic.

    > Directories can take a few minutes to populate.

    Observe the Live Collections icon <img alt="Live Collections icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-live-collections.jpg#icon" width="16px"> denoting a live collection and the counter badge indicating the number of requests.

    ![Live collection enabled](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-live-enabled-v10-19.jpg)

You are ready to [check your LCA connection](#check-your-lca-connection), [navigate your collection](#navigate-live-collections), and [observe live insights](#observe-live-insights) about your endpoints. You can also [review any traffic errors](/docs/live-insights/live-insights-troubleshoot/).

#### Install LCA as a daemon service

Following are instructions for attaching the LCA to the host network in ECS. This option is necessary if you use ECS with bridge networking. If you’d like to install the LCA as a sidecar instead, see [Install LCA as a sidecar](#install-lca-as-a-sidecar).

1. Check [Requirements](#requirements-1) to see the information you need to have. In the **Amazon EC2 console > Resource Groups & Tag Editor**, create a new task definition with **Network mode** set to `host`.

    **Example:** .5 vCPU and .5 MB memory for the agent, and the default task execution role.

    ![ECS daemon configuration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-ecs-daemon-v10-19.jpg)

1. Add a single container in this task definition, running `docker.postman.com/postman-lc-agent`. Delete the port mapping; the agent doesn’t need to expose any services to your network. Add the `POSTMAN_API_KEY` environment variable with your Postman API key set as the value.

    ![ECS container configuration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-ecs-container-v10-19-1.jpg)

1. Configure logging (optional), then expand the **Docker configuration** section.

    Replace the entry point with this string, followed by your collection ID: `/postman-lc-agent,apidump,--collection`.

    ![ECS logging configuration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-ecs-logging-v10-19-1.jpg)

    If you use a particular port number per service, you can specify additional arguments to only capture traffic destined for port `NNNN`: `...,--filter,port NNNN`.

    Or you can use the extra argument to filter by the hostname you use to access the service: `...,-host-allow,HOSTNAME`.

    This parameter can take multiple comma-separated regular expressions if the task is more complicated than a single host.

1. Create a service that runs this task. You can run it as a typical service you can then scale up or down. Alternatively, you can run it as a _daemon_ on every EC2 instance in the cluster.

    Create the task. Switch the **Compute options** to _Launch Type_ and select _EC2_.

    ![ECS service creation](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-ecs-service-v10-19-1.jpg)

1. For **Application type** select _Service_, then select the task definition you created in steps 1–3. For **Service type** select _Daemon_.

    ![ECS deployment configuration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-deployment-configuration-1-v10-19.jpg)

1. Return to Postman and observe subdirectories created for services. You may see additional subdirectories created from health checks of your application's endpoints/traffic.

    > Directories can take a few minutes to populate.

    Observe the Live Collections icon <img alt="Live Collections icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-live-collections.jpg#icon" width="16px"> denoting a live collection and the counter badge indicating the number of requests.

    ![Live collection enabled](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-live-enabled-v10-19.jpg)

You are ready to [check your LCA connection](#check-your-lca-connection), [navigate your collection](#navigate-live-collections), and [observe live insights](#observe-live-insights) about your endpoints. You can also [review any traffic errors](/docs/live-insights/live-insights-troubleshoot/).

#### Uninstall

The LCA installation modifies the task definition of your service to include the LCA sidecar. To uninstall LCA, simply revert to the previous version of your task definition. To completely uninstall the agent, you can delete the task definition that contains the LCA sidecar.

#### Ensure internet access

##### Fargate tasks

To verify that your task has a route to the internet:

* When using a public subnet, you can assign a public IP address to the task ENI.
* When using a private subnet, the subnet can have a NAT gateway attached.

For more information, see [Task networking for tasks hosted on Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/fargate-task-networking.html).

##### EC2 tasks

Tasks must be launched in private subnets with NAT gateway. For more information, see [Task networking for tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html).

#### Set up AWS ECS permissions

Attach the following policy to your AWS profile.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:UpdateService",
                "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:TagResource",
                "ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:DescribeClusters"
                ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

The Live Collections Agent (LCA) CLI needs access to the following permissions in order to install the LCA in ECS. If the profile you selected lacks any of these permissions, the CLI output will show an error message with which action it was attempting to perform.

The `AmazonECS_FullAccess` policy provided by Amazon is a superset of these actions; you could add that entire policy as an easy way to ensure your permissions are sufficient, if they're not already.

| Action                           | Resource                                                                     | Purpose                                                                                             |

### Amazon EC2/Linux Server deployment

If you’re running a Linux instance on EC2, the Postman Live Collection Agent (LCA) can run as a `systemd` service on your server.

The Postman Collection is populated with endpoints observed from the traffic arriving at your service.

To get started using Live Insights, ensure you have a team workspace set up in Postman. If you don’t already have a team in Postman, see [Collaboration overview](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaboration-overview/#creating-a-team) for instructions on how to set it up. Postman Free provides team setup with up to three users. Once your team workspace is set up, contact [Live Insights Alpha team](mailto:live.insights.alpha@postman.com) to get access to the Live Insights alpha in Postman.

Next, [create a collection](#create-a-collection) and [install the LCA locally](#install-the-live-collections-agent-locally). Then, follow the instructions below.

#### Requirements

Configuring EC2/Linux Server requires:

* That your server's OS supports `systemd`.
* root user privileges, so you can enable and configure the agent as a `systemd` service.
* Collection ID. You can find the collection ID by selecting your Postman Collection and then **Info** in the right sidebar.

    ![Get the collection ID](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-collectionID-v10-19.jpg)

* Postman API key. You can copy it from your [API keys](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys) page.

#### Limitations

You can install LCA one EC2 instance at a time. If you want to install on more than one machine, please contact [Support](mailto:observability-support@postman.com).

#### Set up LCA on EC2

1. Check [Requirements](#requirements-1) to see the information you need to have. Then, in your shell, go to your server, log in as a root user, and run the following script, substituting your API key and collection ID values.

    ```bash
    sudo su

    POSTMAN_API_KEY=<postman-api-key> postman-lc-agent setup --collection <postman-collectionID>
    ```

    In the resulting output, the server checks for user permissions and that the systemd is in use, configures systemd files, and enables Postman LCA as a systemd service.

1. Check the status or logs. Run the `journalctl` command:

    ```bash
    journalctl -fu postman-lc-agent
    ```

1. Return to Postman and observe subdirectories created for services. You may see additional subdirectories created from health checks of your application's endpoints/traffic.

> Directories can take a few minutes to populate.

Observe the Live Collections icon <img alt="Live Collections icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-live-collections.jpg#icon" width="16px"> denoting a live collection and the counter badge indicating the number of requests.

![Live collection enabled](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-live-enabled-v10-19.jpg)

You are ready to [check your LCA connection](#check-your-lca-connection), [navigate your collection](#navigate-live-collections), and [observe live insights](#observe-live-insights) about your endpoints. You can also [review any traffic errors](/docs/live-insights/live-insights-troubleshoot/).

#### Uninstall

To turn off the `systemd` service, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now postman-lc-agent
```

## Check your LCA connection

A live collection shows you the properties of your system based on real-time API traffic. For [Live Insights](#observe-live-insights) to work, the Live Collections Agent (LCA) needs to see your API traffic.

Postman provides a diagnostics dashboard where you can observe traffic error states and messages.

To access the diagnostics dashboard:

1. Select the live collection.
2. In the right-hand sidebar, select the Live Collections icon <img alt="Live Collections icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-live-collections.jpg#icon" width="16px">.
3. Select **View Diagnostics**.

![View LCA diagnostics](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-view-diagnostics-v10-19.jpg)

The LCA diagnostics dashboard opens, listing your LCA runs from the most recently started run.

![LCA diagnostics dashboard](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-lca-diagnostics-1-v10-19.jpg)

Postman displays these error states:

* Empty capture
* No telemetry
* Insufficient permissions, try using “sudo” to run as a root

## Navigate Live Collections

The Live Collections Agent (LCA) watches your API traffic to automatically populate your Postman Collection as a _live collection_.

The LCA organizes your API into subdirectories based on hostname or service name. Within each hostname directory, you see endpoints the LCA has seen from that host/service.

Select each request to see the query parameters, path variables, headers and their data formats, and the body of the request/response.

> Live Collections can't currently be edited and will get fully automatically updated every 10 minutes.

Just like with the ordinary collections in Postman, a live collection enabled through the LCA has these elements:

* Query parameters — Sent with your requests using the URL field and the **Params** tab.
* Path variables — Form part of the request URL, and are referenced using placeholders preceded by `:` as in this example: `/customer/:id`.
* Headers — Provide more metadata about the operation you are performing.
* Body — Enables you to specify the data you need to send with a request.
* Response — Gives you several tools to help you understand the response quickly. You can view the body in one of four views: Pretty, Raw, Preview, and Visualize.

## Observe Live Insights

Creating a live collection activates an **Insights** tab where you can observe endpoint error trends, enabling you to catch errors before your users do.

> This feature is experimental and will continue to evolve. Send your feedback and ideas about the types of metrics you would like to see to [Live Insights Alpha team](mailto:live.insights.alpha@postman.com).

Live Insights returns a list of categories for endpoints with most errors, endpoints with the highest error rate, and endpoints with new errors over the last 7 days, selectable from a dropdown list:

* Endpoints with most errors in the past week, based on the HTTP status code of the response.
* Endpoints with the highest proportion of requests that resulted in an error in the past week, based on the HTTP status code of the response.
* Endpoints with new errors in the past day for endpoints that were previously error free for 6 days, based on the HTTP status code of the response.

The **Errors** tab displays per-endpoint error states in a chronological order as well as a graphical representation of the seven-day trend.
