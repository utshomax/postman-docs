**Postman Flows** is a visual tool for building API-driven applications for the [API-first](https://www.postman.com/api-first/) world. You can use Flows to chain requests, handle data, and create real-world workflows in your Postman workspace.

## What is Postman Flows?

Flows is an API-centric visual application development interface. It provides you with an infinite canvas to arrange and connect APIs.

It's powered by the Postman Public API Network and your Collections. Flows provides data manipulation capabilities to bridge the gap between your APIs, and data visualization to show the final output of your Flow.

You can also deploy your Flow and run them in the cloud. Webhooks enable you to integrate with other applications.

## What can you do with Flows?

Flows are the ultimate way to take data from an API-enabled product, manipulate it to meet your needs, and see the results. Or you could take data from one API-enabled product, make decisions or process the data, then send it to another API-enabled product. This means you can build real-time integrations between two API-enabled products.

Try these workspaces featuring Flow examples:

* [Business Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/business-flows/flows)
* [Integration Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/integration-flows/flows)
* [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/natural-language-processing-nlp-flows/flows)
* [Slack Integration Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/slack-integration-flows/flows)
* [DevOps Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/devops-flows/flows)
* [Utility Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/utility-flows/flows)
* [Miscellaneous Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/miscellaneous-flows/flows)

These Flow examples include multiple APIs for different products and tools as well as the related collections and environments. You can [fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) the Flows to your own workspace, try them out, and then make your own changes and customizations.

> Postman Flows is free to try on the Free plan for up to three users. Postman Flows is available as an add-on to the [Basic and Professional plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). Postman Flows isn't currently available in the Enterprise plan.

## Enabling Postman Flows

To get started using Postman Flows in a Professional or Basic plan, assign the Flow Editor role to one or more of your team members. The Flow Editor role is necessary for Professional and Basic plan team members to create, edit, and run Flows. For more information on adding a role to a user, see [Managing team roles](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-team-roles).

The first time a team member in a Professional or Basic plan creates a Flow or selects **Flows** in the sidebar, a dialog notifies the team member that Postman is about to assign them the [Flow Editor](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) role. Select **Continue** to assign the role or **Explore Flows gallery** to browse Flows templates, or close the dialog to cancel assigning the **Flow Editor** role.

## Quick start

To get started, check out the following resources:

* [Navigating a Flow and the Flows interface](/docs/postman-flows/gs/the-flows-interface/)
* [First Flows concept: blocks and connections](/docs/postman-flows/concepts/blocks-and-connections/)
