## Prerequisites

* A free [Slack](https://slack.com/) account
* Understand how webhooks work in flows from the [automatic runs overview](../../concepts/automatic-runs/).

## Contents

* [Connect a flow to a Slack app](#connect-a-flow-to-a-slack-app)
* [Building your own Slack app with Postman Flows](#building-your-own-slack-app-with-postman-flows)

## Connect a flow to a Slack app

Create a new app in Slack [here](https://api.slack.com/apps), give it a name, and then create a slash command which will enable you to interact with it. When making the slash command, use ```https://770fc74bbe7045dcaa56a7261b08c869.flow.pstmn.io``` for the request URL, which is an already-deployed flow that you can find [here](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/utility-flows/flow/642376220544c000387685c5).

Next, enable webhooks so you can send messages to the Slack app from Postman Flows (you'll need to reinstall the app after you do this, as shown in the GIF). Select a channel from Slack that you'll want to interact with it in from the dropdown list.

For the final step, run the command you created in the first step in the Slack channel you installed it to and view your recipe!

## Building your own Slack app with Postman Flows

> **Prerequisites**
>
> 1. Sign up for a free [Slack](https://slack.com/) account.
> 2. Sign up for a free [polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) account and get your API key.

To make your own Slack app from scratch with Postman Flows, follow the same steps as [Connect a Flow to a Slack app](#connect-a-flow-to-a-slack-app). This time, name the app **Stock App**, make the **stock-quote** command, and use the URL of the new flow you're going to make.

Next, fork (which means copy in this case) the collection found [here](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/slack-integration-flows/collection/23919558-0fc87fc5-de53-4c48-b30f-362a1a7ceba3?action=share&creator=23919558) and the environment found [here](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/slack-integration-flows/environment/23919558-144c823d-9dcf-42ff-b85b-66e8e1d41e2a). These contain the saved requests and variables you're going to use in this flow.

In the environment you forked, paste your Polygon.io API key where it says **YOUR_API_KEY_HERE**. You're ready to start building the flow.

To start the flow, create two **Evaluate** blocks, then paste the following functions:
- ```$match(slack_text,'(?<=text=)[^&]+')[0]```
- ```$replace($match(slack_text,'(?<=commands%2F)[^&]+')[0],"%2F","/")``` 

The first function gets the text after the **stock-quote** slash command from the webhook Slack sends. The second function gets the destination in Slack your flow will send the reply to.

Next, copy the text after the **stock-quote** command that you have in the **Evaluate** block (which is the stock ticker). Call the Polygon.io API to get the quote.

Create a **Send Request** block and select **Get stock quote** from the collection that you forked. Select the **Slack Stock Bot** environment you also forked and connect the **Evaluate** block to the ticker variable (this is how information like the ticker is passed from the **Evaluate** block into the **Send Request** block).

The final step is to send all this information back to the Slack app.

Because Slack requires the sent text to be in JSON format, create a **Record** block, name the key **text**, and add a **Select** block. You can either use the dropdown list to select or enter ```body.results.0.c```, which is how Polygon.io stores their stock quotes.

Next, create a new **Send Request** block. Drag the output of the **Record** block to the **message_to_slack** variable, which is what we're going to send to the app. Next, drag a connection from the second **Evaluate** block (which holds the destination in Slack to reply to) to the **slack_hook_url** input of the **Send Request** block.

All that's left is to select the **Deploy** button and try it out in Slack!
