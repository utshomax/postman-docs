_Postman Collections_ are a group of saved requests. Every request you send in Postman appears under the **History** tab of the sidebar. On a small scale, reusing requests through the history section is convenient. As your Postman usage grows, it can be time-consuming to find a particular request in your history. Instead of scrolling through your history section, you can save all your requests as a group for easier access.

## Creating your first collection

To create a new collection, you can start by creating a new request first. You can create a new request from the sidebar in Postman.

To create a collection, do the following:

1. Select **New > HTTP**.

    <img alt="Create new request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/create-new-http-v10-3.jpg" width="500px"/>

1. Enter a request in the request builder and select **Save**.
1. Create a new collection by selecting **New Collection**. Enter a collection name, and then select **Create**.

    <img alt="Save request to collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/save-request-to-collection-v10.jpg" width="500px"/>

1. Select **Save** to save the request in the new collection.

After you save the request, your new collection and the request are listed under **Collections** in the sidebar.

> You can also create a new collection from your workspace's **Overview** tab. Under **In this workspace**, hover over **Collections** and select the **+** icon.
