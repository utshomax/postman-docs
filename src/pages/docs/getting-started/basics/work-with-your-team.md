Postman provides a variety of tools to enable and enhance [collaboration within your team](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-collaboration/).

When you sign up for Postman as an individual, you create your own [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/installation/postman-account/). To collaborate, you can [create](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaboration-overview/#creating-a-team) or join a team. Usually a team includes everyone at your company or organization that uses Postman (not just the group you belong to.)

There are several ways you can join a team. You could be sent an email invite or given an invite link from someone else on a team. Or your organization may add you to a team using SSO, SCIM, or by automatically adding you based on your verified domain name.

Teams have _team workspaces_, which are shared workspaces where your team can work together on APIs, collections, environments, integrations, mocks, monitors, and Flows. Team workspaces can act as a single source of truth for your API projects and encourage collaboration within your team. You can collaborate in several ways:

* [Move elements into a team workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaborating-in-team-workspaces/#moving-elements-to-team-workspaces) to share them with your team.
* [Watch team workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaborating-in-team-workspaces/#watching-team-workspaces) to be notified when teammates make changes.
* [Add comments](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/discussing-your-work/) to discuss work with your team.
* [Share your work](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/) with collaborators or external users.

By default, team workspaces are visible to everyone in your company or organization who uses Postman. You can use [private workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#accessing-private-workspaces) and [user groups](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/user-groups/) to control who can view or make changes in a workspace.

In addition, each user on a team is assigned roles. These define your level of access to a Postman element, like a collection or an API. A Developer role gives you access to team resources. Elevated roles like Admin and Billing can do things like change settings or payment methods. To learn more about roles, visit [defining roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/).
