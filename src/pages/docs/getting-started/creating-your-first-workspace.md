Postman workspaces enable you to organize and work together on API projects with your team. Within each workspace you can share [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/), [collections](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/), [environments](/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/), and other Postman elements.

When you first open Postman, you will be in your default personal workspace. You can create more workspaces for your personal use and to work with teammates. To create more workspaces, you need to sign in to your [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/).

To create a new workspace, do the following:

1. Select **Workspaces** in the upper left. Select **Create Workspace** to add a new workspace. You can also search for existing workspaces using the search bar or select one from the dropdown list.

1. ([Free, Basic, and Professional plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)) You can use [workspace templates](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-workspaces-with-a-template) to help you set up a new workspace. Select a workspace template to populate the workspace with helpful information and sample collections, or select **Blank workspace** to create an empty workspace. Then select **Next**.

    > You can also apply a workspace template to a newly created workspace. To learn more, see [Creating workspaces with a template](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-workspaces-with-a-template).

1. Enter a **Name** and optional **Summary** for your workspace.
1. Choose the workspace's visibility:
    * A **Personal** workspace is visible to you. If you're on an Enterprise team, [Super Admins](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) will also have access to any personal workspaces created within the team.
    * A **Private** workspace is visible to you and to any team members you invite to it ([Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)).
    * A **Team** workspace is visible to everyone on your team.
    * A **Public** workspace is visible to all Postman users.
1. Select **Create** or **Create Workspace**.

Postman will switch to your new workspace when you create it. You can start editing and adding to it right away.

You can move between workspaces at any time by selecting from the dropdown **Workspaces** list in the upper left.
