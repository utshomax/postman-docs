> Importing from New Relic is available on [Postman Free, Basic, and Professional plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

New Relic is an application performance management solution to monitor real-time and trending data for your processes or web apps. You can import data from New Relic into a Postman Collection.

Importing from New Relic requires you to get your API key (User key) from New Relic. After you enter your key, you can select the New Relic services you want to import as collections. The endpoints in each service are imported as requests in a collection.

> There are different types of API keys in New Relic. Make sure to use a **User** key for importing into Postman. To learn more about API Keys in New Relic, see the [New Relic API keys documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/).

## Import New Relic data

1. Select **Import** in the sidebar, then select **New Relic**.
1. Enter the **API Key** (User key) you copied from New Relic, then select **Next**.

1. (Optional) Select **Show Import Settings** to configure how collections are generated from the New Relic data.
