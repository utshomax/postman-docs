Postman can import APIs created with the Swagger toolset and any API that follows a [supported version of the OpenAPI specification](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/#supported-api-definitions-formats).

The terms "Swagger" and "OpenAPI" can be confusing because the OpenAPI specification was previously named SwaggerAPI, and people sometimes use the terms interchangeably. To clarify, in this document, "Swagger API" refers to an API created with the Swagger toolset.

## Import a Swagger API

To import a Swagger API, do the following:

1. Select **Import**.
1. Select files, folders, enter a link to the API, or paste your raw text.

    > You can also import an API definition from a code repository. Learn more about [importing and exporting](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-and-exporting-overview/).

1. Choose to import your API as a **Postman Collection** or as **OpenAPI 3.0 with a Postman Collection**.

    > Select **View Import Settings** for more configuration options. These options will vary depending on your API specification.

1. Select **Import** to bring your API into Postman.

> To learn more ways to import APIs, read [Importing an API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/)
