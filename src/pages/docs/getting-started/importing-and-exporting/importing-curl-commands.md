cURL is a popular command-line tool for making HTTP requests. When testing a web application or API, cURL enables you to interact directly from the command line, using a well-established syntax that's common in the API developer community. If you have several cURL commands in different places, you can import them into Postman.

## Import a cURL command into Postman

1. Select **Import** in the sidebar.
1. Paste your cURL command into the box at the top. Postman creates and opens a request automatically.
