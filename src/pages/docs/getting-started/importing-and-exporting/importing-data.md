You can import collections, API definitions, and other data files so you can work with them in Postman.

To import your data into Postman, select **Import** in the sidebar. You can import your data from files, folders, cURL commands, raw text, or URLs. You can also import data from other sources such as code repositories, API gateways, and application performance management tools.

> You can also import items by dragging and dropping files or folders into Postman.

* [Import from cURL commands](#import-from-curl-commands)
* [Import API definitions](#import-api-definitions)

## Import Postman data

You can import Postman data that you [exported](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/) earlier, including collections, environments, data dumps, and globals. Postman will automatically recognize Postman data on import.

1. Select **Import** in the sidebar.
1. Do one of the following:
    * Select your file or folder, or drag it into Postman.
    * Paste your raw text or URL into the box.
    * Select a button to import from [GitHub](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-git/#import-from-a-remote-git-repository), [AWS API Gateway](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/#importing-api-definitions-from-amazon-api-gateway), or [New Relic](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-new-relic/).
    * Select **Other Sources** to import from a [Bitbucket, GitLab, or Azure](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-git/#import-from-a-remote-git-repository) code repository. You can also import an API from [Azure API Management](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/#importing-api-definitions-from-azure-api-management).

1. If you're importing multiple files, select the files you want to import, then select **Import**.

    > If you are importing a single file, Postman imports it after you select it.

1. An **Import Complete** message displays in the footer. In the message, select the link icon <img alt="External link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-external-link.jpg#icon" width="18px"> next to a collection or environment to open the imported element.

### Convert Postman collections from v1 to v2

Postman no longer supports the collection v1 format and will return an error if you import a collection in this format. You can convert your collection's format from v1 to v2 to import it into Postman.

To convert your collection's format from v1 to v2, do the following:

1. In the terminal of your choice, enter the following command to install the Postman Collection Transformer.

   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g postman-collection-transformer
   ```

1. Convert an individual Postman Collection from v1 to v2 by entering this command:

   ```bash
   postman-collection-transformer convert -i <path to the input Postman Collection file> -o <path to the downloaded Postman file> -j 1.0.0 -p 2.0.0 -P
   ```

The resulting collection will download to your target file path in v2 format.

You can retrieve a list of `convert` options by running the command with the `-h` flag:

   ```bash
   postman-collection-transformer convert -h
   ```

> Go to the [Postman Collection Transformer](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-collection-transformer) for more information about collection conversion.
