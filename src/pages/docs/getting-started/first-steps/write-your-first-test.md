_API tests_ are a way to programmatically assert that your API is behaving as you expect it to. For example, you might write a test to validate your API's error handling by sending a request with incomplete data or wrong parameters. You can write test scripts for your Postman API requests in JavaScript and add them to individual [requests](/docs/sending-requests/requests/), [collections](/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/), and folders in a collection. Postman includes code snippets you can add and then change to suit your test logic.

To write a test, do the following:

1. Go to the request you made in [sending your first request](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sending-the-first-request/).

1. In the request, go to the **Tests** tab.

1. In the snippet section to the right, select the snippet **Status code: Code is 200**. This will enter the following test code:

    ```javascript
    pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
        pm.response.to.have.status(200);
    });
    ```

1. Select **Send**.

After the request runs, the test will run. Go to the **Test Results** section of the response to review the results of your test.

To learn more about writing tests, go to [Writing tests](/docs/writing-scripts/test-scripts/).
