Each time you add a new integration, you need to authenticate with the third-party app or service you want to connect to Postman. _Installed apps_ streamline this process by enabling all members of a team to use the same stored authorization details when adding an integration.

When you authenticate with a third-party service, you can choose to have Postman securely store the authorization details as an installed app. Any team member can add a new integration using the installed app, without needing to know or enter the authorization details.

## Supported integrations

You can add installed apps for the following Postman integrations:

* [GitHub Enterprise Server](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/using-external-git-repo/#connecting-to-github-enterprise-server-or-gitlab-self-managed) - Connect an API to a Git repository hosted in GitHub Enterprise Server
* [GitLab Self-Managed](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/using-external-git-repo/#connecting-to-github-enterprise-server-or-gitlab-self-managed) - Connect an API to a Git repository hosted in GitLab Self-Managed
* [Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/) - Post monitoring results in Slack

## Adding an installed app

You can add an installed app from Team Settings. For Slack, you can also add an installed app when adding a new integration. After you add an installed app, any member of your team can use it add a [supported integration](#supported-integrations).

### Adding an installed app from Team Settings

You can add a new installed app from [Team Settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general).

1. In Postman, select **Team > Team Settings**.
1. Select **Installed apps**.
1. Select the third-party app or service you want to add. The next steps can differ depending on the app or service you selected:

    * **Slack** - A browser tab opens asking you to sign in to Slack. Follow the onscreen instructions. When you're finished, close the browser tab and return to Postman.
    * **GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed** - Enter the client ID and client secret for your OAuth app. For complete steps, go to [Connecting to GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/using-external-git-repo/#connecting-to-github-enterprise-server-or-gitlab-self-managed).

The new installed app appears on the Installed Apps page in [Team Settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general).

## Managing installed apps

You can view all installed apps in [Team Settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general).  In Postman, select **Team > Team Settings**, and then select **Installed apps**. You can view the app name, what it's connected to, and who set up the connection.

To edit an installed app, select the edit icon <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-edit-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="18px"> next to the installed app.

To delete an installed app, select the delete icon <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-delete-v9.jpg#icon" width="12px"> next to the installed app. You must be a [Team Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to delete an installed app.

> **Use caution when deleting an installed app.** If you delete an installed app, any integrations created using the installed app will stop working. You must [re-authenticate the affected integrations](#re-authenticating-an-integration) for them to continue working.

## Adding integrations using installed apps

Any team member can use an installed app when adding a [supported integration](#supported-integrations).

* **Slack** - Follow the steps to add a new [Slack integration](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/). A message and green checkmark let you know you're connected Slack. Enter the other required information and select **Add Integration**.
* **GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed** - You can use the installed app to connect an API to GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed.

## Re-authenticating an integration

If an installed app is deleted, any integrations you added using the installed app will stop working. You must re-authenticate the affected integrations for them to continue working.

* **Slack** - [Edit the Slack integration](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/#viewing-or-editing-integrations) and select **Reauthenticate**. A browser tab opens asking you to sign in to Slack. Follow the onscreen instructions. When you're finished, close the browser tab and return to Postman. Select **Save Changes**.
* **GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed** - Add the installed app again. For details, go to [Connecting an API using an installed app](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/using-external-git-repo/#connecting-an-api-using-an-installed-app).
