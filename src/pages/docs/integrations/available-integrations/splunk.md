Splunk is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications. It combines data from servers, databases, tools, and services to present a unified view of an entire stack. This integration allows you to configure your Postman Monitors to send metrics to Splunk where you can visualize and compare them with other metrics.

To set up a Splunk integration, you must get an HTTP Event Collector (HEC) token from Splunk and configure your monitors. After you set up the integration, you can view real-time alerts based on the results of your monitors.
