You can back up your Postman Collections to your Bitbucket repository. Once the integration is configured, any changes to your collection in Postman will also appear in your Bitbucket repository.

## API sync with Bitbucket

With Postman v10, you can connect a Bitbucket repository to an API in the API Builder. Once connected, you can sync your API's definition and associated collections between Postman and Bitbucket. You can switch branches, pull changes from the repository, and push changes to the repository, all from within Postman. To learn more about syncing your API with Bitbucket, see [API version control overview](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/versioning-an-api-overview/).

Postman often checks your collection for changes. If Postman identifies changes when it checks your collection, the changes automatically commit to your repository in JSON format.

To view your collections in Bitbucket, go to your [Bitbucket dashboard](https://bitbucket.org/dashboard/overview) > **Repositories**. Select your repository, then select **Commits**.
