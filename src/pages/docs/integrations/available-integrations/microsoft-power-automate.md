Microsoft Power Automate enables you to automate workflows between your favorite apps and services to get notifications, synchronize files, collect data, and more. It offers over 140 services with predefined flows that you can implement.

You can configure Microsoft Power Automate with Postman to monitor run results, view team and collection-specific activity feeds, back up your Postman Collections, and use a Microsoft Power Automate Webhook URL.

> **You can view your configured integrations on the [Browse Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations/browse) page.** You can also view integrations that have been configured for a monitor or collection by opening the monitor or collection and selecting the information icon <img alt="Information icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-information-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="16px"> in the right sidebar.

## Get the Microsoft Power Automate webhook URL

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/), and go to **My Flows**. Select **Create from blank**.

    ![create connector](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/ms-pa-create-from-blank-v9.jpg)

1. To add the first step, search for "request" in the search bar. Select the **Triggers** tab, and select **Request / Response - Request**.

    ![select trigger](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/ms-pa-request-v9.jpg)

    ![request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/ms-pa-url-generated-v9.jpg)

1. Select **New Step > Add an Action**, and configure your specific service. For this demo, connect your Postman Monitor to the Microsoft Power Automate mobile app. On every monitor run, you will receive an in-app notification in the Microsoft Power Automate mobile app. Select **Notifications** from the list of services and choose the **Send me a mobile notification** action.

### Back up your Postman Collections in Microsoft Power Automate

It’s important to back up your Postman Collections for safekeeping. Microsoft Power Automate helps you do this with services like Box (a cloud-based storage solution), but you can also use it to back up to your custom DB2 instance.

To back up a collection in Microsoft Power Automate, do the following:

1. Enter the following in the **Add Integration** window:

    * **Nickname** - A nickname for the integration.
    * **Workspace** - The workspace that has the collection you want to back up.
    * **Collection** - The collection you want to back up.
    * **Notification URL** - Your notification URL.

1. Select **Add Integration**.

### Add a collection activity feed to Microsoft Power Automate

In the Postman activity feed, you can view changes your teammates make to your Postman Collection. Integrating with Microsoft Power Automate enables you to send these updates to email services like Outlook, Gmail, or a custom SMTP service. You can also set up Twilio to text you when updates are made to your feed.

To send a collection activity feed to Microsoft Power Automate, do the following:

1. Enter the following in the **Add Integration** window:

    * **Nickname** - A nickname for the integration.
    * **Workspace** - The workspace that has the collection.
    * **Collection** - The collection you want to receive notifications about.
    * **Notification URL** - Your [webhook URL](#get-the-microsoft-power-automate-webhook-url) where your team's updates are sent.

1. Select **Add Integration**.

### Send monitor run results in Microsoft Power Automate

Postman Monitors enable you to run your collections on a schedule with no manual intervention. With the Microsoft Power Automate integration, you can use those results by connecting to other available services.

To send monitor run results to Microsoft Power Automate, do the following:

1. Enter the following in the **Add Integration** window:

    * **Nickname** - A nickname for the integration.
    * **Workspace** - The workspace that has your monitor.
    * **Monitor** - The collection-based monitor which will send its results to Microsoft Power Automate.
    * **Notification URL** - Your notification URL.
    * **Monitor runs notifications** - Select whether you want notifications for all completed monitor runs, or notifications for three monitor run failures and then the first successful monitor run.

1. Select **Add Integration**.

Your integration has been set up. Whenever a monitor runs, you will get a notification on your Microsoft Power Automate mobile app.

### Add a team activity feed to Microsoft Power Automate

In the Postman activity feed, you can track changes made to your collections and within your team. Integrating with Microsoft Power Automate enables you to send these updates to email services like Outlook, Gmail, or a custom SMTP service. You also have the option to set up Twilio to text you when updates are made to your feed.

To send a team activity feed to Microsoft Power Automate, do the following:

1. Enter the following in the **Add Integration** window:

    * **Nickname** - A nickname for the integration.
    * **Webhook URL** - Your [webhook URL](#get-the-microsoft-power-automate-webhook-url) where your team's updates are sent.

1. Select **Add Integration**.
