BigPanda is an IT systems management platform that aggregates and correlates IT alerts to create high-level IT incidents. It directs all alerts to a single place with different connected services.

Setting up a BigPanda integration requires you to get an API key and configure Postman Monitors.

After you set up the integration, you can view real-time alerts based on the results of your monitors.
