[Opsgenie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie) is an incident management and alerting tool that enables you to manage alerts. It has several communication features such as SMS, phone calls, and mobile push notifications, and collaboration features such as escalations and schedules.

The Postman to Opsgenie integration enables you to configure [Postman Monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) to trigger alerts on Opsgenie whenever your monitor fails. Alerts automatically close after a successful run.

## Alerts on Opsgenie

An alert on Opsgenie consists of the following information:

* Description of failing tests
* Number of failed tests
* Number of passed tests
* Number of errors
* Response time

It will also offer a direct link to the failing monitor.

This integration automatically closes a triggered alert if a later run succeeds. This integration also groups failures from the same monitor under a single Opsgenie alert.

When you receive an alert on Postman, you also receive one on your Opsgenie console.

Select the alert in Opsgenie for more information.
