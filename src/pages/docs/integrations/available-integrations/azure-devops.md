Postman enables you to sync your Postman APIs to Microsoft Azure DevOps, an open-source Git repository manager, with the Postman to Azure DevOps integration.

## API sync with Azure DevOps

With Postman v10, you can connect an Azure DevOps repository to an API in the API Builder. Once connected, you can sync your API's definition and associated collections between Postman and Azure DevOps. You can switch branches, pull changes from the repository, and push changes to the repository, all from within Postman. To learn more about syncing your API with Azure DevOps, see [Versioning APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/).
