Postman has a powerful scripting environment that enables you to add JavaScript code (scripts) in your gRPC requests. You can define scripts for two hooks available during the request execution lifecycle:

* Before invoking the method and establishing a connection with the server, in the **Before invoke** tab.
* After closing the connection with the server, in the **After response** tab.

You can use scripts to write API tests, debug your requests (by logging to [Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/troubleshooting-api-requests/), or dynamically read/update the values of [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/).

This is all powered by the [Postman Sandbox](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/postman-sandbox-api/), a JavaScript execution environment available to you while writing your **Before invoke** and **After response** scripts. Whatever code you write in these scripts is executed in the sandbox.

To learn more about writing tests, see [writing tests](/docs/writing-scripts/test-scripts/).
