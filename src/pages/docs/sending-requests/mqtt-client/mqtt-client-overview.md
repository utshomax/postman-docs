MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). Its usage spans from simple devices for home automation and wearables, to automating large-scale industrial machineries. It's a lightweight technology modeled on the publish/subscribe pattern where clients connected to a single broker can publish messages to different topics and subscribe to topics to receive messages from other connected clients. The messages are transferred with low-bandwidth usage, low-power consumption, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers, all adding to the popularity of MQTT.

## Work with MQTT APIs using Postman

Postman provides you with a client interface to debug your MQTT-based APIs. If you haven't already, [download and install the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) to get started.

You can create a new MQTT request, connect to a broker, subscribe to topics, publish messages, and view the messages received from the broker. You can save your MQTT request into a collection to reuse later, document it and share it with your teammates, and publish it to the community on [Postman's public API network](/docs/getting-started/exploring-public-api-network/).
